                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In Seattle, about 12,112 people are currently experiencing homelessness across the county,
                
                <br>Of those, more than half were living unsheltered, including in tents, in vehicles, and on the street.
                <br>According to our research, 73% of the respondents reported at least one unmet health need,
                <br>and they are often neglected.
                </p>
                <p>As a healthcare service, Thrive tries to tackle the problem, we provide services include:
                    <br>Healthcare packages, Pop-up Clinic, mobile app and more.
                <br>Our mission statement: At Thrive, our mission is to make healthcare convenient and accessable
                <br>to people experiencing homelessness.
                <br>Our goal is to connect our clients to resources and empower them to
                be in charge of their own wellness.</p>
